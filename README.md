# Data Structures
##### Copyright © 2019 Thomas Smith.
This repository contains descriptions, examples, and asymptotic complexities for
a variety of useful abstract data types (ADTs) in computer science.

The following ADTs are currently included:
 - [Dictionary](./dictionary.md)
 - [Graph](./graph.md)
 - [List](./list.md)
 - [Priority Queue](./priorityQueue.md)
 - [Queue](./queue.md)
 - [Stack](./stack.md)

## Project Status and Contributions
If you have an ADT you would like to add, submit a pull request with a completed
Markdown file for the data structure. See existing data structures for examples.
Do not attempt to be too comprehensive — add only relevant information.

## Technical Notes
- "Average Complexity" is actually amortized average-case complexity given
  randomized data.
- Although this repository is called "Data Structures," it focused on abstract
  data types instead, relying on their underlying data structures only for
  efficiency measures.
